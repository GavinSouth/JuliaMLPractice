# Overview

I made this short script in Julia to explore different ways this language can be used. 

I played with machine learning, loops, and plotting data frame data to explore some supported libraries and built in plotting functions. 

Overall I found that learning a new language is a lot harder than I thought and that simple syntax is all I could manage to learn. I also experienced the speed capabilities of it through machine learning neural nets.

# Future Work

To learn more about this language, probably by reading a book or going through a class that teaches all of its ins and outs.
